                        Hello, my name is Nick Hodges, and I am new to the world of Software Engineering. I have had my hands on tech for years and I finally decided to further my skills into Web Development.
                        I have obtained my Associates degree and a Business Specialist certificate from Valencia College. I am also currently enrolled in a Coding Bootcamp with the University of Central Florida where I plan to start my Software Engineering career as a Full Stack Developer.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Previously I worked in Customer Service for most of my career. I currently work remotely as a Call Center Representative where I work with different web applications on a computer daily. I also have work experience with Best Buy, where I worked for 5+ years which includes management experience as well. Best Buy is where I was intoduced to coding but I did not decide to get my hands on it until recently.
                        As I am completing this bootcamp with UCF, I notice how much I enjoy coding and I look forward to the skills I will possess that would be valuabe to any employer. 
                    </p>
